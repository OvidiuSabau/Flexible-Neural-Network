# FlexibleNeuralNetwork
A tensorflow model with an easily adjustable number of layers and layer sizes. Also includes a script to load data to the model from .csv files and one to transform images into numpy arrays and .csv files compatible with the network.

As a sort of proof of concept I used this model to train a neural network to identify digits from images and was able to achieve 100%training and 97% testing accuracy without much fine-tuning.The script to train the model and predict using the model is still found in the frontend file
